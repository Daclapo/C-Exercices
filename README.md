# C Programming Exercises - 42Cursus & 42Piscine

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my C programming exercises and projects developed at [42Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com). Here, you’ll find solutions to tasks from the 42Piscine (introductory C programming bootcamp) and 42Cursus (main curriculum projects). These exercises reflect the progressive learning and challenges of the 42 curriculum.

## Description

This repository includes exercises and projects divided into two main sections:
- **42Piscine**: .
- **42Cursus**: 

- **42Piscine**: Contains foundational C and shell exercises from the piscine, an intensive selection bootcamp at 42Madrid. These exercises cover topics such as:
  - Basic syntax and control flow
  - Loops and conditionals
  - Functions and recursion
  - Memory management with pointers
  - Basic data structures (arrays, strings, matrices, etc.)

- **42Cursus**: Projects from the main curriculum at 42Madrid, focused on advanced C programming and broader computer science concepts, including:
  - File handling and system-level programming
  - Dynamic memory allocation
  - Advanced data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues)
  - Networking and multi-threading basics
  - Performance optimization and algorithm design


The repository showcases a progression from basic to advanced projects, reflecting the structured learning path at 42Madrid.
